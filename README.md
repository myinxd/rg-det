# Radio Galaxies Detection (rg-det)
The radio galaxies are a flock of small-scale but high-luminousity sources in the Universe, which should be detected either to study on, or to be eliminated for the 21cm signal task. In this repo, we will try to detect them in two ways, one is with conventional image processing methods, and the other is utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning object detection algorithms.

## Support languages
Most of the scrips are written by python, while some are by MATLAB for its highly efficient operation on matrices.
